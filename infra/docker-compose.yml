# Docker Compose configuration for the complete hackathon environment
# Defines services for attacker, proxy, network capture, and agent
# Expresses how volumes are shared between services:
#   - telemetry logs
#   - PCAP/flow summaries be carefull here, can slow down everything, see network dockerfile
#   - BlueFlux output reports
# Serves as a single "run this to see the demo" artifact

#Docker log timestamps and Network timestamps might drift. Ensure all containers use UTC
